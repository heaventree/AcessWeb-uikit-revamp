## About ACCESS_WEB_V9_7_REFERENCE Folder

**GOLDEN RULE: The ACCESS_WEB_V9_7_REFERENCE folder is FOR REFERENCE ONLY.**

This folder contains the base AccessWebPro application code and should NEVER be used as a source for or storage of our work. It exists solely to:

1. Provide reference for the underlying structure our skin will sit on top of
2. Show navigation items that can be used as a sitemap for our work
3. Help us understand what components we need to style
4. Serve as an example of existing implementation patterns

**DO NOT modify, copy to, or store any of our UI skin code within this folder.** All our UI skin development should be separate from this reference codebase.

We may extract data such as navigation items, component structures, and page layouts to understand what we need to style, but our implementation must remain independent. This separation ensures our skin can be properly applied as a layer on top of the core application.

## Project Overview

AccessWebPro is creating a modern, accessible UI skin that must meet WCAG accessibility standards while maintaining a visually appealing, minimalist aesthetic. The design features teal/mint accent colors (#0fae96) alongside primary blue (#0066FF), gradient backgrounds, and pill-shaped buttons.

## Updates

### April 19, 2025 - 10:40 PM EST

#### Accomplishments
- Implemented comprehensive text sizing updates across landing page components to meet WCAG 1.4.4 (Resize Text) requirements:
  - Increased text size in pricing section from 'text-sm' to 'text-base' for the "INCLUDES:" label
  - Enlarged "Most Popular" badge text from 'text-sm' to 'text-base'
  - Enhanced icon sizes in FAQ section from 3px to 4px
  - Increased container sizes for FAQ icons from 6px to 8px for better visibility
  - Increased spacing between FAQ elements for improved readability
  - Enlarged social media icons in footer from 16px to 18px
  - Increased social media icon containers from 8x8px to 10x10px to meet WCAG 2.5.5 touch target size requirements
  - Adjusted spacing between social media icons for better separation

#### Outstanding Issues
- Need to verify contrast ratios in all states (hover, focus, active) for interactive elements
- WCAGToolbar implementation is complete but could benefit from additional features
- Some complex form elements might need additional accessibility improvements

#### Next Steps
1. Test all interactive elements with keyboard navigation to ensure proper focus states
2. Add ARIA labels to interactive elements without visible text
3. Implement focus indicator styles that meet WCAG 2.4.7 requirements
4. Consider adding skip navigation links for keyboard users
5. Create a comprehensive accessibility audit report checking all WCAG criteria
