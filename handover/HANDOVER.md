## Project Overview

#### Accomplishments
- Implemented comprehensive text sizing updates across landing page components to meet WCAG 1.4.4 (Resize Text) requirements:
  - Increased text size in pricing section from 'text-sm' to 'text-base' for the "INCLUDES:" label
  - Enlarged "Most Popular" badge text from 'text-sm' to 'text-base'
  - Enhanced icon sizes in FAQ section from 3px to 4px
  - Increased container sizes for FAQ icons from 6px to 8px for better visibility
  - Increased spacing between FAQ elements for improved readability
  - Enlarged social media icons in footer from 16px to 18px
  - Increased social media icon containers from 8x8px to 10x10px to meet WCAG 2.5.5 touch target size requirements
  - Adjusted spacing between social media icons for better separation

#### Outstanding Issues
- Need to verify contrast ratios in all states (hover, focus, active) for interactive elements
- WCAGToolbar implementation is complete but could benefit from additional features
- Some complex form elements might need additional accessibility improvements

#### Next Steps
1. Test all interactive elements with keyboard navigation to ensure proper focus states
2. Add ARIA labels to interactive elements without visible text
3. Implement focus indicator styles that meet WCAG 2.4.7 requirements
4. Consider adding skip navigation links for keyboard users
5. Create a comprehensive accessibility audit report checking all WCAG criteria
