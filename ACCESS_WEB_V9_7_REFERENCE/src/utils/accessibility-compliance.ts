/**
 * WCAG Accessibility Compliance Guide for WCAG 9.4 Audit Tool
 * 
 * This file serves as a guide for ensuring our own UI components comply with WCAG 2.2 standards.
 * Key principles implemented:
 * 1. Perceivable - Information must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive
 * 2. Operable - Interface components must be operable
 * 3. Understandable - Information and operation must be understandable
 * 4. Robust - Content must be robust enough to work with current and future technologies
 * 
 * Compliance level: AA (our target)
