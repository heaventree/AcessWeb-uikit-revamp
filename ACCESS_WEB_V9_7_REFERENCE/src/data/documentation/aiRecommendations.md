# AI Recommendations Guide

## Overview

The AI Recommendations feature uses advanced machine learning to provide intelligent, context-aware suggestions for fixing accessibility issues. Powered by OpenAI's technology, this tool analyzes detected issues and generates specific, actionable recommendations tailored to your website's unique structure and content.

## Key Features

- **Smart Issue Analysis**: AI-powered examination of accessibility problems
- **Contextual Recommendations**: Suggestions that account for your site's specific structure
- **Code Snippets**: Ready-to-use code examples for fixing issues
- **Plain Language Explanations**: Clear, non-technical descriptions of problems and solutions
- **WCAG Compliance Guidance**: References to relevant WCAG criteria for each recommendation

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the WCAG Checker page
2. Enter the URL you want to analyze
3. Make sure the "Enable AI Recommendations" option is checked
4. Click "Analyze URL"
5. For each detected issue, look for the "AI Recommendation" button
6. Click the button to generate an intelligent, customized fix for that specific issue

## Understanding AI Recommendations

### Types of Recommendations

The AI system provides several types of recommendations:

- **Quick Fixes**: Simple, immediate solutions for straightforward issues
- **Code Modifications**: Specific code changes to address technical problems
- **Structural Suggestions**: Recommendations for broader structural improvements
- **Alternative Approaches**: Different ways to solve complex accessibility challenges
- **Best Practice Guidance**: General advice for improving overall accessibility

### How Recommendations Work

When you request an AI recommendation:

1. The system analyzes the specific accessibility issue in context
2. It examines your page's HTML structure, CSS, and other relevant factors
3. It generates tailored recommendations based on WCAG guidelines and best practices
4. The recommendation includes explanations, code examples, and implementation guidance

## Pro Tips

1. **Review Before Implementing**: Always review AI recommendations before applying them to ensure they fit your site's needs.

2. **Context Matters**: Provide detailed information when requesting specific recommendations for better results.

3. **Combine Approaches**: Use AI recommendations alongside manual testing for the most comprehensive accessibility solutions.

4. **Iterative Process**: After implementing recommendations, re-test to verify issues have been resolved and no new issues were introduced.

5. **Feedback Loop**: The system improves with use; providing feedback on recommendations helps refine future suggestions.

## Limitations

- AI recommendations work best with valid, well-structured HTML
- Some complex issues may require human judgment to implement correctly
- Recommendations focus on WCAG compliance but may not address all user experience aspects
- Performance depends on the quality and completeness of the page analysis
