# URL Design Analysis Guide

## Overview

URL Design Analysis examines the structure and readability of your website's URLs to ensure they meet accessibility best practices. Well-designed URLs provide context, improve user orientation, and enhance the overall accessibility of your website, especially for users with cognitive disabilities or those using screen readers.

## Key Features

- **URL Readability Analysis**: Evaluates how descriptive and user-friendly URLs are
- **Keyword Presence Check**: Verifies if URLs contain relevant keywords
- **URL Length Assessment**: Checks if URLs are concise yet descriptive
- **Special Character Detection**: Identifies problematic special characters in URLs
- **URL Structure Evaluation**: Assesses the hierarchical organization of URL paths

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the WCAG Checker page
2. Enter the URL you want to analyze
3. Make sure the "Test HTML Structure" option is enabled (this includes URL analysis)
4. Click "Analyze URL"
5. Navigate to the "Structure" tab in the results section
6. Look for the "URL Design Issues" category to view URL-related concerns

## Understanding the Results

### URL Design Issues

The URL Design section of the results identifies issues such as:

- **Non-Descriptive URLs**: URLs that don't clearly indicate content purpose
- **Excessively Long URLs**: URLs that are unnecessarily long or complex
- **Special Character Problems**: URLs with characters that may cause accessibility issues
- **Query Parameter Issues**: Overuse of query parameters that reduce clarity
- **Inconsistent Structure**: Variations in URL structure across the site

Each issue includes:
- A detailed description of the problem
- The WCAG success criterion it relates to
- A specific recommendation for improving the URL design

### Common Issues Detected

1. **Random String IDs in URLs**
   - WCAG Reference: 2.4.4 (Level A), 2.4.6 (Level AA)
   - Description: URLs containing random characters or numeric IDs (e.g., /p/12345) provide no context about content.
   - Solution: Use descriptive slugs (e.g., /products/wireless-headphones).

2. **Excessive Query Parameters**
   - WCAG Reference: 2.4.4 (Level A)
   - Description: Too many query parameters make URLs difficult to read and understand.
   - Solution: Use clean URL structures with path segments instead of numerous query parameters.

3. **Special Character Usage**
   - WCAG Reference: 2.4.4 (Level A)
   - Description: Special characters can cause issues for screen readers and when URLs are spoken aloud.
   - Solution: Use hyphens instead of underscores or spaces, and minimize special characters.

4. **Overly Long URLs**
   - WCAG Reference: 2.4.4 (Level A), 3.1.5 (Level AAA)
   - Description: Excessively long URLs are difficult to remember, share, and understand.
   - Solution: Keep URLs concise while maintaining descriptiveness.

5. **Missing Keywords**
   - WCAG Reference: 2.4.4 (Level A), 2.4.6 (Level AA)
   - Description: URLs lacking relevant keywords provide no context about page content.
   - Solution: Include primary keywords that describe the page content.

## Pro Tips

1. **Semantic Structure**: Structure URLs to reflect your site's information architecture.

2. **Consistent Patterns**: Maintain consistent URL patterns across your entire website.

3. **Future-Proofing**: Design URLs that won't need to change even if your technology stack changes.

4. **Language Considerations**: For multilingual sites, consider how URL structure handles different languages.

5. **Avoid Session IDs**: Don't include session IDs or user-specific information in URLs when possible.
