  "content": "# Multimedia Accessibility: Captions and Transcripts\n\n**Focus**: Making audio and video content accessible to users with auditory or visual disabilities.\n\n**Captions (Guideline 1.2.2 - Level A (minimum accessibility requirements) for Prerecorded, 1.2.4 - Level A (minimum accessibility requirements)A for Live)**:\n*   **What**: Synchronized text for dialogue and important non-speech audio (e.g., [door slams], [music playing]).\n*   **Who**: Primarily benefits users who are deaf or hard of hearing, but also useful in noisy environments or for non-native speakers.\n*   **How**: Typically provided as Closed Captions (user can toggle on/off) via formats like WebVTT or SRT.\n\n**Audio Descriptions (Guideline 1.2.3 - Level A (minimum accessibility requirements) / 1.2.5 - Level A (minimum accessibility requirements)A for Prerecorded)**:\n*   **What**: Narration added to the soundtrack to describe important visual details that cannot be understood from the main soundtrack alone.\n*   **Who**: Primarily benefits users who are blind or have low vision.\n*   **How**: Integrated into the audio track during pauses or via a separate descriptive track. Extended descriptions (Level A (minimum accessibility requirements)A) pause the video if needed.\n\n**Transcripts (Guideline 1.2.1 - Level A (minimum accessibility requirements) for Audio-only/Video-only, 1.2.3 - Level A (minimum accessibility requirements) as alternative for Synced Media)**:\n*   **What**: A full text version of the spoken audio and relevant non-speech sounds. For video, it should also describe important visual information.\n*   **Who**: Benefits users who are deaf, hard of hearing, deaf-blind, or anyone who prefers/needs to read the content. Also makes content searchable.\n*   **How**: Provided as an HTML page or downloadable document linked near the media.\n\n**Best Practice**: Provide captions and transcripts for all prerecorded multimedia. Provide audio descriptions where visual information is critical.",
