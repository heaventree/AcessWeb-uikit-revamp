  "content": "# Understanding WCAG: Principles and Guidelines\n\n**What is WCAG?**: The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are developed through the W3C process in cooperation with individuals and organizations around the world, with a goal of providing a single shared standard for web content accessibility that meets the needs of individuals, organizations, and governments internationally.\n\n**The Four Principles (POUR)**: WCAG is organized around four core principles:\n1.  **Perceivable**: Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive (e.g., providing text alternatives for non-text content, captions for audio).\n2.  **Operable**: User interface components and navigation must be operable (e.g., all functionality available from a keyboard, users have enough time to read and use content).\n3.  **Understandable**: Information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable (e.g., text is readable, content appears and operates in predictable ways).\n4.  **Robust**: Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies (e.g., maximizing compatibility with current and future user tools).\n\n**Guidelines**: Under each principle are guidelines (e.g., Guideline 1.1 Text Alternatives, Guideline 2.4 Navigable) that provide the basic goals developers should work toward.",
