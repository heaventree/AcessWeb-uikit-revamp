### Data Models

**User Progress Model:**
```typescript
interface UserProgress {
  userId: string;
  pathwayId: string;
  completedSteps: string[];
  currentStep: string;
  startedAt: string;
  lastAccessedAt: string;
  completionPercentage: number;
  earnedAchievements: Achievement[];
}

interface Achievement {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  unlockedAt: string;
  iconUrl: string;
}
```

**Pathway Model:**
```typescript
interface Pathway {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  targetRole: UserRole;
  targetProjectType: ProjectType;
  steps: PathwayStep[];
  prerequisites: string[];
  estimatedTimeMinutes: number;
}

interface PathwayStep {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  content: StepContent;
  type: StepType;
  nextSteps: string[];
  previousSteps: string[];
}
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
