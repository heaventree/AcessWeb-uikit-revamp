# Content Reorganization Plan

This document outlines a practical approach for improving content organization across the WCAG 9.4 Audit platform while minimizing disruptive changes.

## Current Content Structure

Currently, our content is spread across several sections:

- **/docs**: Technical documentation and implementation guides
- **/help**: General help articles and FAQs
- **/blog**: News, updates, and long-form content
- **/integrations**: Integration-specific documentation
- **/wcag-resources**: WCAG accessibility resource articles

## Issues Identified

1. **Content Duplication**: Similar content exists across multiple sections
2. **Navigation Complexity**: Users struggle to find relevant information
3. **Inconsistent Formatting**: Content style varies between sections
4. **Weak Cross-Referencing**: Related content isn't properly linked
5. **Unclear Information Architecture**: Content organization lacks intuitive structure

## Reorganization Strategy

### 1. Metadata Enhancement (Non-destructive)

Add consistent metadata to content without changing file structure:

- Add "related articles" section to each content file
- Standardize tags across all content
- Add clear categorization fields
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing content structure

### 2. Content Audit and Classification

1. Catalog all existing content
2. Classify content according to the unified model
3. Identify duplicate or near-duplicate content
4. Map related content connections

### 3. Section-Specific Improvements

#### WCAG Resources Section

- Implement consistent article formatting
- Add implementation examples for each guideline
- Create clear categorization by WCAG principles
- Add difficulty indicators for implementation guidance

#### Documentation Section

- Reorganize by user role (developer, designer, content creator)
- Create sequential tutorials for major implementation tasks
- Add code sample repository with working examples
- Implement versioning for API documentation

#### Help Center

- Reorganize by common user tasks
- Create troubleshooting decision trees
- Add searchable FAQ database
- Implement contextual help system

#### Blog

- Categorize by topic and target audience
- Create curated content collections
- Implement related article recommendations
- Add author profiles and expertise indicators

#### Integrations

- Standardize documentation format across integration types
- Create step-by-step setup guides with visual aids
- Add troubleshooting sections for common issues
- Implement integration-specific examples

### 4. Cross-Referencing Implementation

- Add "Related Resources" section to each content item
- Implement "See Also" sidebar with contextually relevant links
- Create topic clusters with hierarchical navigation
- Add breadcrumb navigation to show content relationships

### 5. Navigation Improvements

- Implement faceted search across all content
- Create role-based navigation paths
- Add content type filters
- Implement saved search and favorites functionality
- Add "Recently Viewed" section

### 6. Implementation Timeline

1. **Phase 1**: Content audit and classification (2 weeks)
2. **Phase 2**: Content consolidation and duplicate removal (2 weeks)
3. **Phase 3**: Metadata enhancement and cross-referencing (2 weeks)
4. **Phase 4**: Navigation and search improvements (3 weeks)
5. **Phase 5**: User testing and refinement (1 week)

## Success Metrics

We'll measure the success of this reorganization using:

1. Time to find specific information (user testing)
2. Search success rate
3. Navigation path analysis
4. User satisfaction surveys
5. Support ticket reduction for documentation-related questions
